## Build the vote service container

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **File** > **Open Folder** to open the **app/vote-service** project folder. 

2. Open the VS Code integrated terminal by selecting **View** > **Terminal**.

3. Build the container using docker build command. 

    ```
    docker build -t  <ACR login server>/<name-of-container>:<tag-name> .
    ```

    Docker building should take ~1-2 minutes. If everything was successful, you the docker should be ready to push to your container registry. Run `docker image list` to check, for example, you will see:

    ```
    REPOSITORY                           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    aksedgeneo.azurecr.io/vote-service   latest    0928eb2bf3ca   10 seconds ago   181MB
    ```

## Login to container registry

Sign in to Docker by entering the following command in the terminal. Sign in with the username, password, and login server from your Azure container registry. You can retrieve these values from the **Access keys** section of your registry in the Azure portal.

```
docker login -u <ACR username> -p <ACR password> <ACR login server>
```

> ðŸ’¡You may receive a security warning recommending the use of --password-stdin. While that best practice is recommended for production scenarios, it's outside the scope of this tutorial. For more information, see the docker login reference.

## Push to container registry

In the previous section, you created and build the service container image. Now you need to push it to your Azure container registry.

Push the container image to the Azure container registry

```
docker push <ACR login server>/<name-of-container>:<tag-name>
```

At the end, you will be able to see a digest for your container image.
